Here is a checklist with the tasks to be performed on any new Quarkiverse extension repository: 

# Requesting a new repository

## [Create an `Extension Proposal` issue](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/new?assignees=&labels=kind%2Fextension-proposal&template=extension_proposal.yml) in the Quarkus repository 

The core team can then decide if the extension should belong to core or as a Quarkiverse extension. Please indicate the lead maintainers for the extension, and preferably a URL with more information about the technology the extension should enable. 

Once the lead maintainers are identified (their GitHub accounts), a pull-request is created in the [Quarkiverse DevOps repository](https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkiverse-devops) with the data provided in a [`.tf` file](https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkiverse-devops#workflow-for-new-repositories) (because the pull-request needs to be created from a branch in the same repository, existing Quarkiverse members can do this without waiting for any Quarkiverse org owner).

| :exclamation:  IMPORTANT   |
|----------------------------|
If you need to change any setting in the repository (give push permissions to anyone, enable a GitHub app, etc.), make sure you perform these changes in the repository's `.tf` file. Changes performed in the GitHub UI directly can be discarded at any time without notice.   

# After the repository is created

## [Integrate with the Quarkus Ecosystem CI](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-ecosystem-ci#what-its-all-about)

If you wish to have your extension tested against the latest snapshot in Quarkus core, you need to register your extension in the Quarkus Ecosystem CI

1. Create an [Ecosystem CI issue](https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkiverse/issues/new/choose) and assign to the extension lead 
2. In the [Ecosystem CI repository](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-ecosystem-ci), create a `info.yaml` file in a `quarkiverse-<YOUR_EXTENSION>` directory with the following contents:

```yaml
url: https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-<YOUR_EXTENSION>
issues:
  repo: quarkiverse/quarkiverse
  latestCommit: <the issue number you created in the previous step>
``` 

## [Register the extension documentation in the quarkiverse-docs](https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkiverse-docs)

In order to have your [extension documentation](https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkiverse/wiki#documenting-your-extension) listed in the [Quarkiverse Documentation website](https://quarkiverse.github.io/quarkiverse-docs/), open a PR including it in the [antora-playbook.yml](https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkiverse-docs/blob/main/antora-playbook.yml)

## [Make your extension available in the tooling](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-extension-catalog#extensions)

Create a `YAML` file with your extension's `group-id` and `artifact-id` in the [quarkus-extension-catalog repository](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus-extension-catalog/tree/main/extensions)  

# When your extension is ready

## [Release your extension](https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkiverse/wiki/Release) 

When all tests pass, and you're pretty confident that your extension is ready, it's time to [release your extension](https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkiverse/wiki/Release) to Maven central
